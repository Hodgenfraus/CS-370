Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The bulk of the code for this project was provided; buth of the .py files were completely unaltered by me. The .ipynb file was completely written by me. In essense, this project was employing maching learning techniques to find an optimal solution to a puzzle; this process involved calling random directional movement until the puzzle was solved, then repeating that process to optimize performance.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

  Computer scientists, like all scientists, employ the scientific method to to further the understanding of the world around us. Whether by improving current processes in technology, or developing new hardware or software, computer scientists are tasked with the ethical and responsible furthering of technological development.
  
  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

  I think the biggest concern in computer science today is the ethical use of the technologies with which we are just now familiarizing ourselves. These technologies include facial recognition, machine learning, and AI to name a few. There have been countless occurances of unethical performance by these technologies, such as racist or sexists business practices or proceedures. My approach to design as a computer scientists will always be, first and foremost, with ethical proceedures in mind.
